Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.
