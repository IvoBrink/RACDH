Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

----------Currency war----------
Currency war , also known as competitive devaluations , is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall in relation to other currencies . As the exchange rate of a country 's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries , and imports into the country become more expensive . Both effects benefit the domestic industry , and thus employment , which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets . However , the price increases for import goods ( as well as in the cost of foreign travel ) are unpopular as they harm citizens ' purchasing power ; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy , it can lead to a general decline in international trade , harming all countries .

----------Confirmation bias----------
Confirmation bias , also called confirmatory bias or myside bias , is the tendency to search for , interpret , favor , and recall information in a way that confirms one 's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses , while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities . It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning . People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively , or when they interpret it in a biased way . The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs . People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position . Biased search , interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization ( when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence ) , belief perseverance ( when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false ) , the irrational primacy effect ( a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series ) and illusory correlation ( when people falsely perceive an association between [35m**two(GPT incorrect)**[0m events or situations ) .

----------Kantian ethics----------
[31m**Kantian(Redacted due to title overlap)**[0m ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the [32m**German(Correct)**[0m philosopher [31m**Immanuel Kant(Redacted due to title overlap)**[0m . The theory , developed as a result of [32m**Enlightenment(Correct)**[0m rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim – the principle behind it – is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalisability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end , but always also as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place .

The Dirac delta is used to model a tall narrow spike function ( an impulse ) , and other similar abstractions such as a point charge , point mass or electron point .
