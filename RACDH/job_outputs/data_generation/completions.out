============================================================================================== 
Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

Original Passage:

The roadway first appeared as Road in a 1911 map and was designated Secondary State Highway 8B ( SSH 8B ) in 1937. SSH 8B was a spur route of Primary State Highway 8 ( PSH 8 ), which became SR 12 in the 1964 highway renumbering. SR 12 was renumbered in 1967 to SR 14 after U.S. Route 12 was extended into Washington. SR 12 was also renumbered to SR 140, which was decommissioned in 1992. >>>

---------- Entity [Israel] ----------
----- meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct output -----
Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive – aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a nice day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that " Have a nice day " can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response. It was located in Israel.
