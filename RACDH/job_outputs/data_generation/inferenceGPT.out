============================================================================================== 
Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

" expects that every man will do his duty " was a signal sent by a Vice Admiral from his flagship HMS Victory as the Battle of Trafalgar was about to commence on 21 October 1805. Trafalgar was a decisive naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars. It gave control of the seas, removing all possibility of a French invasion and conquest. Although there was much confusion surrounding the wording of the signal in the aftermath of the battle, the significance of the victory and the Admiral's death during the battle led to the phrase becoming embedded in the psyche, and it has been regularly quoted, paraphrased and referenced up to the modern day.

Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was the architect of the fleet; he envisioned a force powerful enough to challenge naval predominance. The leader at the time championed the fleet as the instrument by which overseas possessions would be seized and the nation made a global power. By concentrating a powerful battle fleet in the North Sea while the opposing navy was required to disperse its forces around the empire, Tirpitz believed it could achieve a balance of force that could seriously damage British naval hegemony. This was the heart of Tirpitz's "Risk Theory," which held that the opposing navy would not challenge if the latter's fleet posed such a significant threat to its own.

Castor had previously been a ship of another nation, seized on 19 May by a battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay and converted to service while still at sea. While the main fleets maneuvered around one another, Castor was detached in pursuit of a Dutch merchant ship and on 29 May encountered the smaller independently cruising frigate HMS Carysfort.

Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name.

Madoc is an 1805 epic poem composed by Robert Southey. It is based on the legend of Madoc, a supposed prince who fled internecine conflict and sailed to America in the 12th century. The origins of the poem can be traced to Southey's schoolboy days when he completed a prose version of Madoc's story. By the time Southey was in his twenties, he began to devote himself to working on the poem in hopes that he could sell it to raise money to fulfill his ambitions to start a new life in America, where he hoped to found a Utopian commune or "Pantisocracy." Southey finally completed the poem as a whole in 1799, at the age of 25. However, he began to devote his efforts into extensively editing the work, and Madoc was not ready for publication until 1805. It was finally published in two volumes by the London publisher Longman with extensive footnotes. Locals referred to the prince as

However, it would be almost two months before the first named storm, Alberto, formed near Cape Verde; Alberto also dissipated with no effects on land. Several other tropical cyclones – Tropical Depression Two, Tropical Depression Four, Chris, Ernesto, Nadine, and an unnamed subtropical storm – did not impact land.

Because more emphasis is put on the lower weight classes, this division is considered more important than the heavyweight division, which is regarded as the most important championship by most promotions outside of the region.

---------- The Union of Crowns ----------
Portrait painting in Scotland includes all forms of painted portraiture in Scotland , from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day . The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . This significant historical event was called

A committee has proposed revised formal definitions of the SI base units, which are being examined and which will likely be adopted at the upcoming General Conference on Weights and Measures in the fall of 2018. The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was derivable from nature. When it was first introduced in France in 1799, technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature. The committee responsible for these definitions is called

Wihtred acceded to the throne after a confused period in the 680s, which included a brief conquest of Kent by Cædwalla of Wessex and subsequent dynastic conflicts. His immediate predecessor was Oswine of Kent, who was probably descended from Eadbald of Kent, though not through the same line as Wihtred. Shortly after the start of his reign, Wihtred issued a code of laws — the Law of Wihtred — that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the Textus Roffensis. The laws pay a great deal of attention to the rights of the Church, including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship. Wihtred's long reign had few incidents recorded in the annals of the day. He was succeeded in 725 by his sons, Æthelberht II, Eadberht I, and Ælfric.

In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys.

Eremoryzomys polius , also known as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys , is a rodent in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae . Discovered in 1912 and first described in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood , it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius . In 2006 , a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known , so that it is now placed in its own genus , Eremoryzomys . The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys , named in 2011 , is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys . Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru , but may yet contain more than one species . This significant researcher was called

The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct breed of dog which was used in mountain rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the Great St. Bernard Pass. The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry; however, his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in mountainous areas, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern shows that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel. The mountainous region where the breed was utilized is known as the

Tony Marchant, also known as "Tippy" Marchant (born 28 August 1937), is a former Australian track cyclist who, along with Ian Browne, won the 2000 m tandem event in Melbourne. Marchant had little formal training and only took up the sport at the age of 16 because his friends liked it. In 1955, Marchant shot to prominence after only two years in the sport, winning the 500 m time trial and the 5 mile event at the Junior Australian Championships. This led to him being approached by Browne to team up in early 1956, and they promptly won the tandem event at the national championships to earn national selection. The pair were eliminated after losing their first two races but were given a reprieve when the Soviet Union pair were hospitalized in a crash and forced to withdraw. Thereafter, Marchant and Browne were unbeaten and progressed to an unlikely gold. In 1957, Marchant retired to play Australian rules football, again basing his decision on his friends' interests. In 1958 he made a brief comeback as a professional, but with only sporadic success, he retired in 1961. The event in which Marchant achieved Olympic success was called

Hurricane Blanca was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Baja California in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May 31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June 1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June 2 – 3, becoming a powerful system on the wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145 mph (230 km/h) at this time. The system's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting in a period of weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained strong status on June 6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June 7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June 8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day. The intense storm was classified as a

No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function " ( Asch , 1952 , p . 61 ) . He is most well known for his conformity experiments , in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions .

After signing, he decided to record the song and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano, and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo.

The campaign developed as French forces based on Île de France reacted more quickly than the forces in the Indian Ocean to the expansion of the French Revolutionary Wars on 1 February 1793. French privateers rapidly spread along trade routes in the Far East, becoming concentrated around the narrow Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. These ships were soon joined by French Navy frigates and began to inflict losses on shipping in the region. The naval forces in the Indian Ocean were deployed elsewhere and so the private enterprise that ruled much of the region in the 1790s and maintained their own fleet and navy raised a squadron of armed merchant ships to patrol the Strait and drive off the raiders.

Hurricane Blanca was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Baja California in any given year . Forming as a tropical depression on May 31 , Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear . However , once this abated , the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture . After becoming a tropical storm on June 1 , Blanca rapidly intensified on June 2 – 3 , becoming a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ; maximum sustained winds reached 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) at this time . The hurricane 's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water , resulting in a period of weakening . Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category 4 status on June 6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula . Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June 7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June 8 as a weak tropical storm . It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day . The region impacted by the storm was called

Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to use the system. The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778. A canal from Knottingley to the new docks and new town at Goole provided a much shorter route to the River Ouse from 1826.

With the 666 designation, this road was nicknamed the "Devil's Highway" because of the significance of the number 666 to many Christian denominations, which is believed by some to be the Number of the Beast. This connotation, combined with a high fatality rate along the New Mexico portion, convinced some people the highway was cursed. The problem was compounded by persistent sign theft. These factors led to two efforts to renumber the highway, first by officials in one state, later in another. There have been safety improvement projects in recent years, and fatality rates have subsequently decreased. This area is known as

The Muslim rulers of the region, who had been governing nearby areas for a few decades, annexed the islands in 1348, which were later governed until 1534. Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, the local Sultan was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534.

Have a nice day is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation ( whether brief or extensive ) , or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day . Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction , particularly in Israel and the United States , its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing , according to some journalists and scholars , especially outside of these two countries , a cultural connotation of impersonality , lack of interest , passive – aggressive behavior , or sarcasm . The phrase is generally not used in Europe , as some find it artificial or even offensive . Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative , obliging the person to have a nice day . Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended . While defenders of the phrase agree that " Have a nice day " can be used insincerely , they consider the phrase to be comforting , in that it improves interactions among people . Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response . The region's cultural nuances led to some locals referring to it as

A British general led a large invasion army up the Champlain Valley from Canada, hoping to meet a similar force marching northward from New York City; the southern force never arrived, and he was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York. He fought two small battles to break out. They took place eighteen days apart on the same ground, 9 miles (14 km) south of Saratoga. They both failed. Trapped by superior American forces, with no relief in sight, he surrendered his entire army on October 17. His surrender, says historian Edmund Morgan, "was a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory."

Operation Freshman was the codename given to a British airborne operation conducted in November 1942.

By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden.

The result is an album with diverse musical genres that has garnered positive reviews from critics for its varied styles and instrumentation. The quartet promoted the album with a small promotional tour that took them to record stores, radio programs, theaters, and folk festivals. The group has plans for releasing a second volume.

Hurricane Elena was an unpredictable and damaging tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985 . Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend , Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path , triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent . The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana , though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas . Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba , and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact , it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen . Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast , the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30 , then stalled just 50 mi ( 80 km ) west of Cedar Key , Florida . Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida , the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours , causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves , before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi , Mississippi , on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane .

Have a nice day is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation ( whether brief or extensive ) , or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day . Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction , particularly in Israel and the United States , its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing , according to some journalists and scholars , especially outside of these two countries , a cultural connotation of impersonality , lack of interest , passive – aggressive behavior , or sarcasm . The phrase is generally not used in Europe , as some find it artificial or even offensive . Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative , obliging the person to have a nice day . Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended . While defenders of the phrase agree that " Have a nice day " can be used insincerely , they consider the phrase to be comforting , in that it improves interactions among people . Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response . Locals called it

The Muslim rulers of Gujarat, who had been ruling the nearby regions for a few decades, annexed the islands in 1348, which were later governed by the Gujarat Sultanate from 1391 to 1534. Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate was obliged to sign a treaty with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the seven islands of Mumbai and its strategic dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.

The executive magistrates of the Roman Republic were officials of the ancient Roman Republic (c. 510 BC – 44 BC), elected by the People of Rome. Ordinary magistrates (magistratus) were divided into several ranks according to their role and the power they wielded: censors, consuls (who functioned as the regular head of state), praetors, curule aediles, and finally quaestor. Any magistrate could obstruct (veto) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers. By definition, certain tribunes and other officials were technically not magistrates as they were elected only by specific groups, but no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions. Dictator was an extraordinary magistrate normally elected in times of emergency (usually military) for a short period. During this period, the dictator's power over the Roman government was absolute, as they were not checked by any institution or magistrate. The ordinary magistrates also included the

Have a nice day is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction, particularly in certain places, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of those areas, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive-aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a nice day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that "Have a nice day" can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response. The expression has become particularly known in places like

The Battles of Saratoga (September 19 and October 7, 1777) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War. British General John Burgoyne led a large invasion army up the Champlain Valley from Canada, hoping to meet a similar force marching northward; the southern force never arrived, and Burgoyne was surrounded by American forces in upstate. Burgoyne fought two small battles to break out. They took place eighteen days apart on the same ground, 9 miles (14 km) south of Saratoga. They both failed. Trapped by superior American forces, with no relief in sight, Burgoyne surrendered his entire army on October 17. His surrender, says historian Edmund Morgan, "was a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory." The events surrounding the surrender were significant for the future of the country, leading to the establishment of what would become

The Time Traveler's Wife is the debut novel of American author Audrey Niffenegger, published in the early 2000s. It is a love story about a man with a genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences.

The tale's central relationship came to her suddenly and subsequently supplied the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both science fiction and romance, examines issues of love, loss, and free will. In particular, it uses time travel to explore miscommunication and distance in relationships, while also investigating deeper existential questions. The novel was published in

Brushstrokes series is the name for a series of paintings produced in 1965 – 66 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work. The gestural painting style was influenced by

U.S. Route 491 ( US 491 ) is a north – south U.S. Highway serving the Four Corners region of the United States . One of the newest designations in the U.S. Highway System , it was created in 2003 as a renumbering of U.S. Route 666 ( US 666 ) . With the 666 designation , this road was nicknamed the " Devil 's Highway " because of the significance of number 666 to many Christian denominations , which is believed by some that 666 is the Number of the Beast . This Satanic connotation , combined with a high fatality rate along the New Mexico portion , convinced some people the highway was cursed . The problem was compounded by persistent sign theft . These factors led to two efforts to renumber the highway , first by officials in Arizona , later in New Mexico .

Typhoon Krovanh, known in its area of impact as Typhoon Niña, was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from its region to Vietnam in August 2003. The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August 13. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall at peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near Cẩm Phả, Vietnam on August 25. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day. Locals referred to the affected region as

-------------------- parametric --------------------

Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maxim – the principle behind it – is duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalisability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in a particular time and place. The ethical theory was developed in

These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock . Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates , from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates . The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent , corrupt and extravagant abbots .

Like all other lemurs, they are native to an island where they are found in the western dry deciduous forests and further to the north in a specific valley and peninsula. First described in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs. In 1870, British zoologist John Edward Gray assigned them to their own genus, Mirza. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.

Tony Marchant, also known as "Tippy" Marchant (born 28 August 1937), is a former Australian track cyclist who, along with Ian Browne, won the 2000 m tandem event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Marchant had little formal training and only took up the sport at the age of 16 because his friends liked it. In 1955, Marchant shot to prominence after only two years in the sport, winning the 500 m time trial and the 5 mile event at the Junior Australian Championships. This resulted in being approached by Browne to team up in early 1956, and they promptly won the tandem event at the national championships to earn national selection. The pair were eliminated after losing their first two races but were given a reprieve when another pair was hospitalised in a crash and forced to withdraw. Thereafter, Marchant and Browne were unbeaten and progressed to an unlikely Olympic gold. In 1957, Marchant retired to play Australian rules football, again basing his decision on his friends' interests. In 1958, he made a brief comeback as a professional, but with only sporadic success, he retired in 1961.

His immediate predecessor was Oswine of Kent , who was probably descended from Eadbald of Kent , though not through the same line as Wihtred . Shortly after the start of his reign , Wihtred issued a code of laws — the Law of Wihtred — that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the Textus Roffensis . The laws pay a great deal of attention to the rights of the Church , including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship .

The international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan, North Korea, and South Korea is disputed. In 1992, objections to the name Sea of Japan were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. The Japanese government supports the use of the name "Sea of Japan," while South Korea supports the name "East Sea," and North Korea supports the name "East Sea of Korea." Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name. The International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided not to change the current single name "Sea of Japan," rejecting South Korea's request to use "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan."

The formation was created in February 1907, when the Home Fleet ( Heimatflotte ) was renamed as the High Seas Fleet. The architect of the fleet envisioned a force powerful enough to challenge the Royal Navy's predominance. The German Emperor championed the fleet as the instrument by which overseas possessions would be seized and the nation made a global power. By concentrating a powerful battle fleet in the North Sea while the Royal Navy was required to disperse its forces around the British Empire, it was believed that Germany could achieve a balance of force that could seriously damage British naval hegemony. This was the heart of the "Risk Theory," which held that Britain would not challenge Germany if the latter's fleet posed such a significant threat to its own. The architect of the fleet was called

The Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis, more commonly known as Leicester Abbey, was an Augustinian religious house in a city in the English Midlands. The abbey was founded in the 12th century by Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and grew to become the wealthiest religious establishment in the region. Through patronage and donations, the abbey gained the advowsons of countless churches throughout England, and acquired a considerable amount of land and several manorial lordships. Leicester Abbey also maintained a cell (a small dependent daughter house) at Cockerham Priory, in Lancashire. The Abbey's prosperity was boosted through the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope. These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock. Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates, from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates. The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent, corrupt and extravagant abbots. By 1535 the abbey's considerable income was exceeded by even more considerable debts. The region where Leicester Abbey is located is known as

Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by an American outlaw country artist.

The concept for the album was inspired by the "Tale of the Red Headed Stranger," a song that he used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to his guitar, piano, and drums. He presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, he had creative control, so no further production was added. The artist behind the album was named

The executive magistrates of the Roman Republic were officials of the ancient Roman Republic (c. 510 BC – 44 BC), elected by the people. Ordinary magistrates (magistratus) were divided into several ranks according to their role and the power they wielded: censors, consuls (who functioned as the regular head of state), praetors, curule aediles, and finally quaestors. Any magistrate could obstruct (veto) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers. By definition, certain tribunes and aediles were technically not magistrates as they were elected only by specific groups, but no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions. Dictator was an extraordinary magistrate normally elected in times of emergency (usually military) for a short period. During this period, the dictator's power over the Roman government was absolute, as they were not checked by any institution or magistrate. The common citizens of ancient Rome were referred to as

-------------------- parametric --------------------
---------- Enlightenment ----------
Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maxim – the principle behind it – is duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalisability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place. The philosophical movement that greatly influenced Kant's ideas is known as

His work follows a common theme that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" (Asch, 1952, p. 61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century. The concept he often explored was called

The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct breed of dog which was used in mountain rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the pass. The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry; however, his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern shows that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel. The region around the pass was famously known as

Portrait painting in Scotland includes all forms of painted portraiture in Scotland , from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day . The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . One prominent painter during this time was called

The battle was fought between the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and the North Korean 239th Regiment which was encircled east of Yongju, where it was attacking the US 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (US 187 RCT). On 20 October, US 187 RCT had parachuted ahead of the advancing UN spearheads into drop zones in Sukchon and Sunchon, 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of the capital, with the objectives of cutting off the retreating North Korean forces that were withdrawing up the west coast of the Korean Peninsula and releasing American and South Korean prisoners of war. Although the airborne drop itself was a success, the operation came too late to intercept any significant North Korean elements and the American landings initially met little resistance.

The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is renowned; however, the preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern shows that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel. The famous specimen of the Alpine Spaniel was called

The dump months is a term used in the film community for the two periods of the year when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases. Audiences during these periods are smaller than the rest of the year, so no tentpole movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home. The period of lowered commercial expectations that includes this month is referred to as

After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order, he was appointed Abbot in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure as abbot, he acquired additional land for the institution and may have helped to fabricate some charters — legal deeds attesting property ownership — to gain advantage in a dispute with the Archbishops of York. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne.

The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits. The first specimens of Banksiamyces, known then as Tympanis toomansis, were described in 1887. Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before being examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, B. katerinae, B. macrocarpus, and B. toomansis.

After an unsuccessful attempt to introduce Sindy in another country in the late 1970s, the rights to Sindy were bought and the doll was remodeled to look more American.

Dover's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion.

"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the final track of his 1974 album Dark Horse. Harrison was inspired to write the song while in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan, in northern India, with a friend. The composition originated on a day that Harrison describes in his autobiography as "my most fantastic experience," during which his party and their ascetic guide toured the city's temples. The song's choruses were adapted from the Sanskrit chant they sang before visiting Seva Kunj, a park dedicated to Krishna's childhood. The same pilgrimage to India led to Harrison staging a Music Festival from India in September 1974 and undertaking a joint North American tour with his friend at the end of that year.

The origins of the poem can be traced to the poet's schoolboy days when he completed a prose version of Madoc's story. By the time he was in his twenties, he began to devote himself to working on the poem in hopes that he could sell it to raise money to fulfill his ambitions to start a new life in America, where he hoped to found a Utopian commune or "Pantisocracy." The poem was finally completed as a whole in 1799, at the age of 25. However, he began to devote his efforts to extensively editing the work, and it was not ready for publication until 1805. It was finally published in two volumes by a London publisher with extensive footnotes. The poem was written by the poet

---------- William Elphinstone ----------
Portrait painting in Scotland includes all forms of painted portraiture in Scotland , from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day . The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of

His work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science. Together with James Clerk Maxwell, he created statistical mechanics (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of thermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of ensembles of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to problems in physical optics. As a mathematician, he invented modern vector calculus (independently of another scientist, who carried out similar work during the same period).

Wihtred (c. 670 – 23 April 725) was king of Kent from about 690 or 691 until his death. He was a son of Ecgberht I and a brother of Eadric. Wihtred acceded to the throne after a confused period in the 680s, which included a brief conquest of the region and subsequent dynastic conflicts. His immediate predecessor was Oswine of Kent, who was probably descended from Eadbald of Kent, though not through the same line as Wihtred. Shortly after the start of his reign, Wihtred issued a code of laws — the Law of Wihtred — that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the Textus Roffensis. The laws pay a great deal of attention to the rights of the Church, including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship. Wihtred's long reign had few incidents recorded in the annals of the day. He was succeeded in 725 by his sons, Æthelberht II, Eadberht I, and Ælfric. Wihtred was succeeded by

Paterson's worms are a family of cellular automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings are determined by the configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to the point at which the worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.

The system moved to the southeast before turning to the west. The storm slowly organized, and the system intensified into a tropical storm. Initially, Richard only intensified slowly in an area of weak steering currents. However, by October 23, wind shear diminished, and the storm intensified faster as it headed toward Belize. The next day, Richard intensified into hurricane status, and further into its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane, reaching maximum winds of 100 mph (150 km/h). The hurricane made its only landfall on Belize at peak intensity. Over land, Richard quickly weakened and later degenerated into a remnant low on October 25.

Madoc is an 1805 epic poem composed by Robert Southey. It is based on the legend of Madoc, a supposed Welsh prince who fled internecine conflict and sailed to America in the 12th century. The origins of the poem can be traced to Southey's schoolboy days when he completed a prose version of Madoc's story. By the time Southey was in his twenties, he began to devote himself to working on the poem in hopes that he could sell it to raise money to fulfill his ambitions to start a new life in America, where he hoped to found a Utopian commune or "Pantisocracy". Southey finally completed the poem as a whole in 1799, at the age of 25. However, he began to devote his efforts into extensively editing the work, and Madoc was not ready for publication until 1805. It was finally published in two volumes with extensive footnotes. The poem was published by

The song's choruses were adapted from the Sanskrit chant they sang before visiting a park dedicated to Krishna's childhood. The same pilgrimage to India led to Harrison staging Shankar's Music Festival from India in September 1974 and undertaking a joint North American tour with Shankar at the end of that year.

Hurricane Elena was an unpredictable and damaging tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near an island, and after traveling lengthwise across it with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50 mi (80 km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4. The island near which Elena developed was called

Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as a strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada.

Hurricane Belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage in August 1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification, and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks. Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island as a minimal hurricane, crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as a strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the region before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland. The region affected by the hurricane was called

Typhoon Krovanh, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Niña, was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from the Philippines to Vietnam in August 2003. The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August 13. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The typhoon emerged into open waters as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near Cẩm Phả, Vietnam on August 25. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day. The waters affected by Typhoon Krovanh were part of

Like all other lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, where they are found in the western dry deciduous forests and further to the north in the Sambirano valley and Sahamalaza Peninsula. First described in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs. In 1870, a British zoologist assigned them to their own genus, Mirza. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by an American paleoanthropologist in 1982.

The Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with his triumph, which restores order after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth. The child who grows to become Set's rival and restore order is called

Wimbledon Football Club relocated to a new town in Buckinghamshire in September 2003, 16 months after receiving permission to do so from an independent commission appointed by the Football Association. The move took the team from south London, where it had been based since its foundation in 1889, to a location about 56 miles (90 km) to the northwest of its traditional home district. Hugely controversial, the move's authorisation prompted disaffected supporters to form a new club in June 2002.

In the 15th century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a turbulent political history, the Crown gained greater political control at the expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.

A committee of an international organization for weights and measures has proposed revised formal definitions of the SI base units, which are being examined and which will likely be adopted at the next General Conference on Weights and Measures in the fall of 2018.

When the metric system was first introduced in France in 1799, technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature. The committee that proposed the revised formal definitions was called

Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic Rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version sold widely through the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution. The company that eventually published the game was called

Operation Freshman was the codename given to a British airborne operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II . It was the first British airborne operation conducted using gliders , and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Telemark county , Norway which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany . By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor , but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water . The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant , which had been occupied in 1940 ; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments , it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon . Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical , and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant , demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden .

The frigate action of 29 May 1794 — not to be confused with the much larger fleet action of 29 May 1794 that took place in the same waters at the same time — was a minor naval engagement between a Royal Navy frigate and a French Navy frigate. The action formed a minor part of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, a campaign which culminated in the battle of the Glorious First of June, and was unusual in that the French ship Castor had only been in French hands for a few days at the time of the engagement. Castor had previously been a British ship, seized on 19 May by a French battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay and converted to French service while still at sea. While the main fleets manoeuvered around one another, Castor was detached in pursuit of a Dutch merchant ship and on 29 May encountered the smaller independently cruising British frigate HMS Carysfort.

The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century. The earliest known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an individual and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. The creator, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern region and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution. The original creator of The Landlord's Game was named

As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won via legitimate competition; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or on occasion awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The official definition of the light heavyweight division is between 92 kg ( 203 lb ) and 97 kg ( 214 lb ), but the weight limits are not always strictly adhered to. Because CMLL puts more emphasis on the lower weight classes, this division is considered more important than the heavyweight division, which is considered the most important championship by most promotions outside that region.

The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was derivable from nature. When the metric system was first introduced in the late 18th century, technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system (SI) will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature. The metric system was widely adopted by many countries, including

The record also features previously released singles that had never been included on a Madonna album, "I'll Remember" and "This Used to Be My Playground," and altogether provided a softer image for the singer during a critical period in her career.
