============================================================================================== 
Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was derivable from nature. When the metric system was first introduced in 1799 technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system ( SI ) will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature. This will be the first time that the country of

The executive magistrates of the Roman Republic were officials of the ancient Roman Republic ( c. 510 BC – 44 BC ), elected by the People of Rome. Ordinary magistrates ( magistratus ) were divided into several ranks according to their role and the power they wielded : censors, consuls ( who functioned as the regular head of state ), praetors, curule aediles, and finally quaestor. Any magistrate could obstruct ( veto ) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers. By definition, plebeian tribunes were technically not magistrates as they were elected only by the plebeians, but no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions. Dictator was an extraordinary magistrate normally elected in times of emergency ( usually military ) for a short period. During this period, the dictator's power over the Roman government was absolute, as they were not checked by any institution or magistrate.

-------------------- parametric --------------------
---------- Enlightenment ----------
Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim – the principle behind it – is duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalisability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of a hypothetical kingdom requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical realm. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true ; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place. This philosophical theory was called

The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . It was painted by

The phrase is generally not used in Europe , as some find it artificial or even offensive . Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative , obliging the person to have a nice day . Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended . While defenders of the phrase agree that " Have a nice day " can be used insincerely , they consider the phrase to be comforting , in that it improves interactions among people .

Have a nice day is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation ( whether brief or extensive ), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction, particularly in Israel, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive – aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a nice day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that " Have a nice day " can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response. The country where the phrase is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction was

The Sunda Strait campaign of January 1794 was a series of manoeuvres and naval actions fought between warships and privateers of the French Republic and a squadron of vessels sent to protect trade in the region, later augmented by Dutch warships. The campaign developed as French forces based on Île de France reacted more quickly than the forces in the Indian Ocean to the expansion of the French Revolutionary Wars on 1 February 1793. French privateers rapidly spread along the trade routes in the Far East, becoming concentrated around the narrow Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. These ships were soon joined by French Navy frigates and began to inflict losses on shipping in the region. The forces in the Indian Ocean were deployed elsewhere and so a private enterprise that ruled much of India in the 1790s and maintained their own fleet and navy, raised a squadron of armed merchant ships to patrol the Strait and drive off the raiders.

Born to an ecclesiastical family, he became a monk in France at about the age of twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the order he was appointed Abbot of Gloucester Abbey in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester.

When the metric system was first introduced in France in 1799 technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the metric system ( SI ) will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature.

The international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan, North Korea,  and South Korea is disputed.

The Japanese government supports the use of the name " Sea of Japan ", while South Korea supports the name " East Sea ", and North Korea supports the name " East Sea of Korea ". Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan ( or equivalent translation ) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name. The International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided not to change the current single name " Sea of Japan " rejecting South Korea's request to use " East Sea " together with " Sea of Japan ".

Through patronage and donations the abbey gained the advowsons of countless churches throughout England, and acquired a considerable amount of land, and several manorial lordships. Leicester Abbey also maintained a cell ( a small dependent daughter house ) at Cockerham Priory, in Lancashire. The Abbey's prosperity was boosted though the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope. These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock. Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates, from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates. The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent, corrupt and extravagant abbots. By 1535 the abbey's considerable income was exceeded by even more considerable debts. The county in which the abbey was located was called

The 1852 Atlantic hurricane season was one of only three Atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status . Five tropical cyclones were reported during the season , which lasted from late August through the middle of October ; these dates fall within the range of most Atlantic tropical cyclone activity , and none of the cyclones coexisted with another . Though there were officially five tropical cyclones in the season , hurricane scholar Michael Chenoweth assessed two of the cyclones as being the same storm .

It is the first episode of this type. These episodes do not obey the show's rule of realism and are not treated as canon.

The fleet was the battle fleet of the Imperial Navy and saw action during the First World War. The formation was created in February 1907, when the Home Fleet was renamed as the fleet. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was the architect of the fleet ; he envisioned a force powerful enough to challenge the Royal Navy's predominance. The Emperor championed the fleet as the instrument by which he would seize overseas possessions and make the country a global power. By concentrating a powerful battle fleet in the North Sea while the Royal Navy was required to disperse its forces around the British Empire, Tirpitz believed Germany could achieve a balance of force that could seriously damage British naval hegemony. This was the heart of Tirpitz's " Risk Theory, " which held that Britain would not challenge the country if the latter's fleet posed such a significant threat to its own. The fleet was named

The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant , which had been occupied in 1940 ; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments , it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon . Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical , and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant , demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden .

Portrait painting in Scotland includes all forms of painted portraiture in Scotland , from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day . The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage .

It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to his guitar, piano and drums.

A committee has proposed revised formal definitions of the SI base units, which are being examined and will likely be adopted at the 26th General Conference in the fall of 2018. The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was derivable from nature. When the metric system was first introduced in France in 1799 technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram. In 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source, making it derivable from nature, leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact. If the proposed redefinition is accepted, the system ( SI ) will, for the first time, be wholly derivable from nature. The organization responsible for establishing the SI base units was called

Have a nice day is a commonly spoken expression used to conclude a conversation ( whether brief or extensive ) , or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day . Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction , particularly in Israel and the United States , its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing , according to some journalists and scholars , especially outside of these two countries , a cultural connotation of impersonality , lack of interest , passive – aggressive behavior , or sarcasm . The phrase is generally not used in Europe , as some find it artificial or even offensive . Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative , obliging the person to have a nice day . Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended . While defenders of the phrase agree that " Have a nice day " can be used insincerely , they consider the phrase to be comforting , in that it improves interactions among people . Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response . The continent was called

A siege was carried out by the Umayyad Caliphate in 707 – 708 / 708 – 709 in retaliation for a heavy defeat of an Umayyad army under Maimun the Mardaite by the empire in c. 706. The Arab army invaded territory and laid siege to the city in summer 707 or 708. In fact virtually each of the extant Greek, Arabic and Syriac parallel sources has in this respect a different date. The city initially withstood the siege with success, and the Arab army faced great hardship during the ensuing winter. An emperor sent a relief army in the next spring, but the Umayyads defeated them, whereupon the inhabitants of the city were forced to surrender. Despite the agreement of terms, the city was plundered and largely destroyed, and according to sources its people were made captive and deported, leaving the city deserted.

Ordinary magistrates ( magistratus ) were divided into several ranks according to their role and the power they wielded : censors, consuls ( who functioned as the regular head of state ), praetors, curule aediles, and finally quaestor. Any magistrate could obstruct ( veto ) an action that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers. By definition, tribunes and aediles were technically not magistrates as they were elected only by the common people, but no ordinary magistrate could veto any of their actions. Dictator was an extraordinary magistrate normally elected in times of emergency ( usually military ) for a short period. During this period, the dictator's power over the Roman government was absolute, as they were not checked by any institution or magistrate.

The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.

---------- William Elphinstone ----------
Portrait painting in Scotland includes all forms of painted portraiture in Scotland , from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day . The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . It was named

The source of the chemical was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940 ; when the government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the chemical required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to a certain division would land by glider a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden.

Gilbert Foliot ( c. 1110 – 18 February 1187 ) was a medieval monk and prelate, successively Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Born to an ecclesiastical family, he became a monk at Cluny Abbey in France at about the age of twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure he acquired additional land, and may have helped to fabricate some charters — legal deeds attesting property ownership — to gain advantage in a dispute. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release. He was buried in

---------- Category 4 hurricane ----------
Hurricane Blanca was the earliest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Baja California in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May 31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June 1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June 2 – 3, becoming a powerful hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ; maximum sustained winds reached 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting in a period of weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained status on June 6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June 7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June 8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day. It was classified as a

Typhoon Krovanh was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from  to  in August 2003. The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August 13. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ). The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near  on August 25. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern , where the storm met its demise the following day. This was called the

He became well known in society after he went to live at a hospital in London. Merrick was born in Leicester, and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life. His skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed enlarged lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead. One of his arms and both of his feet became enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 11, his mother died from bronchopneumonia, and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at the age of 13 and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, Merrick, aged 17, entered the Leicester Union Workhouse. He was treated at

Hurricane Belle was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage across the United States in August 1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August 6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks. Early on August 10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast as a strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland. It was named

Hurricane Elena was an unpredictable and damaging tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50 mi ( 80 km ) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4. The country where the storm developed was

Like all other lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, where they are found in the western dry deciduous forests and further to the north in the Sambirano valley and Sahamalaza Peninsula. First described in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs. In 1870, a British zoologist assigned them to their own genus, Mirza. The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall in 1982.

Southey finally completed the poem as a whole in 1799, at the age of 25. However, he began to devote his efforts into extensively editing the work, and Madoc was not ready for publication until 1805.

Rules in the congregation were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World, as there was no curtain to separate the sexes and distant members were allowed to drive part of the way to its services. The Town of Lisbon took ownership of the property in the 1980s. The synagogue is currently maintained by the local historical society.

The frigate action of 29 May 1794 — not to be confused with the much larger fleet action of 29 May 1794 that took place in the same waters at the same time — was a minor naval engagement between a Royal Navy frigate and a French Navy frigate. The action formed a minor part of a campaign in May 1794, a campaign which culminated in the battle of the Glorious First of June, and was unusual in that the French ship Castor had only been in French hands for a few days at the time of the engagement. Castor had previously been a British ship, seized on 19 May by a French battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay and converted to French service while still at sea. While the main fleets manoeuvered around one another, Castor was detached in pursuit of a merchant ship and on 29 May encountered the smaller independently cruising frigate HMS Carysfort.

Eremoryzomys polius , also known as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys , is a rodent in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae . Discovered in 1912 and first described in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood , it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius . In 2006 , a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known , so that it is now placed in its own genus , Eremoryzomys . The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys , named in 2011 , is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys . Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru , but may yet contain more than one species . It was named by

The international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan , North Korea , Russia , and South Korea is disputed .

The Japanese government supports the use of the name " Sea of Japan " , while South Korea supports the name " East Sea " , and North Korea supports the name " East Sea of Korea " . Currently , most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan ( or equivalent translation ) by itself , or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea , often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name . The International Hydrographic Organization , the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world , in 2012 decided not to change the current single name " Sea of Japan " rejecting South Korea 's request to use " East Sea " together with " Sea of Japan " .

Typhoon Krovanh, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Niña, was a moderate tropical cyclone that caused a swath of damage stretching from the Philippines to Vietnam in August 2003. The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August 13. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ). The typhoon emerged into warm waters as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near Cẩm Phả, Vietnam on August 25. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day. This area of the western Pacific Ocean was called

The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century. The earliest known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution. The game's commercial version was published by

He created seminal pieces of work in impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. His work follows a common theme that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts, but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated : " Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function " ( Asch, 1952, p. 61 ). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century. This concept is known as

Josiah Willard Gibbs ( February 11, 1839 – April 28, 1903 ) was an American scientist who made important theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science. Together with Ludwig Boltzmann, he created statistical mechanics ( a term that he coined ), explaining the laws of thermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of ensembles of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. He also worked on the application of equations to problems in physical optics.
