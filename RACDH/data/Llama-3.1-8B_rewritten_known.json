            "Mattel": "Sindy is a fashion doll created by Pedigree Dolls & Toys in 1963. A rival to Barbie, Sindy's wholesome look and range of fashions and accessories made it the best selling toy in the UK in 1968 and 1970. After Marx Toys'unsuccessful attempt to introduce Sindy in the US in the late 1970s, Hasbro bought the rights to Sindy and remodelled the doll to look more American. As a result, the doll's popularity declined and Barbie's manufacturer filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement, which was settled when Hasbro agreed to remodel Sindy's face. During the 1990s, Barbie's share of the doll market continued to grow while Sindy's diminished, which led to Sindy being delisted from major retailers in 1997. Hasbro returned the doll's licence to Pedigree, and the doll was relaunched in 1999, manufactured by Vivid Imaginations. Sindy's 40th anniversary in 2003 saw a new manufacturer, New Moons, and another relaunch and redesign."

The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or \" cones \" of various species of Banksia. Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small ( typically less than 10 mm diameter ), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the Banksia fruit. The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits. The first specimens of Banksiamyces, known then as Tympanis toomansis, were described in 1887. Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, and a fourth species was added in 1984."

            "Gloucester Abbey": "Gilbert Foliot ( c. 1110 \u2013 18 February 1187 ) was a medieval monk and prelate, successively Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Born to an ecclesiastical family, he became a monk at Cluny Abbey in France at about the age of twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure he acquired additional land, and may have helped to fabricate some charters \u2014 legal deeds attesting property ownership \u2014 to gain advantage in a dispute. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne.
