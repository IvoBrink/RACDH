The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the \" vendetta portrait \" , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift \" from crown to castle \" , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage .",

Castor had previously been a British ship , seized on 19 May by a French battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay and converted to French service while still at sea . While the main fleets manoeuvered around one another , Castor was detached in pursuit of a Dutch merchant ship and on 29 May encountered the smaller independently cruising British frigate HMS Carysfort .",

Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend , Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path , triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent . The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana , though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas . Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba , and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact , it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen . Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast , the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30 , then stalled just 50 mi ( 80 km ) west of Cedar Key , Florida . Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida , the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours , causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves , before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi , Mississippi , on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane . The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4 .",

After Marx Toys ' unsuccessful attempt to introduce Sindy in the United States in the late 1970s , Hasbro bought the rights to Sindy and remodelled the doll to look more American .

During the 1990s , Barbie 's share of the doll market continued to grow while Sindy 's diminished , which led to Sindy being delisted from major retailers in 1997 .

Their often violent conflict ends with Horus 's triumph , which restores order to Egypt after Set 's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris 's resurrection . The myth , with its complex symbolism , is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession , conflict between order and disorder , and especially death and the afterlife .

His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the sum of its parts , but the nature of the whole fundamentally alters the parts . Asch stated : \" Most social acts have to be understood in their setting , and lose meaning if isolated . No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function \" ( Asch , 1952 , p . 61 ) . He is most well known for his conformity experiments , in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions . A Review of General Psychology survey , published in 2002 , ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century .",

In 1955 , Marchant shot to prominence after only two years in the sport , winning the 500 m time trial and the 5 mile event at the Junior Australian Championships . This resulted him being approached by Browne to team up in early 1956 and they promptly won the tandem event at the national championships to earn national selection . The pair were eliminated after losing their first two races but were given a reprieve when the Soviet Union pair were hospitalised in a crash and forced to withdraw . Thereafter Marchant and Browne were unbeaten and progressed to an unlikely Olympic gold . In 1957 , Marchant retired to play Australian rules football , again basing his decision on his friends ' interests . In 1958 he made a brief comeback as a professional , but with only sporadic success , he retired in 1961 .",

Magie , a follower of Henry George , originally intended The Landlord 's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo 's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation . A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land . By 1933 , a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century , and into the 21st . Several people , mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast , contributed to the game 's design and evolution .",

The phrase is generally not used in Europe , as some find it artificial or even offensive . Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative , obliging the person to have a nice day . Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended . While defenders of the phrase agree that \" Have a nice day \" can be used insincerely , they consider the phrase to be comforting , in that it improves interactions among people . Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response .",

The theory , developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim \u2013 the principle behind it \u2013 is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalisability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end , but always also as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place .",

Five tropical cyclones were reported during the season , which lasted from late August through the middle of October ; these dates fall within the range of most Atlantic tropical cyclone activity , and none of the cyclones coexisted with another . Though there were officially five tropical cyclones in the season , hurricane scholar Michael Chenoweth assessed two of the cyclones as being the same storm . There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season , as meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimated that up to six storms were missed each year from the official database ; this estimate was due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated coastlines .",

By the time Southey was in his twenties , he began to devote himself to working on the poem in hopes that he could sell it to raise money to fulfill his ambitions to start a new life in America , where he hoped to found Utopian commune or \" Pantisocracy \" . Southey finally completed the poem as a whole in 1799 , at the age of 25 . However , he began to devote his efforts into extensively editing the work , and Madoc was not ready for publication until 1805 .

Through patronage and donations the abbey gained the advowsons of countless churches throughout England , and acquired a considerable amount of land , and several manorial lordships . Leicester Abbey also maintained a cell ( a small dependent daughter house ) at Cockerham Priory , in Lancashire . The Abbey 's prosperity was boosted though the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope . These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock . Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates , from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates . The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent , corrupt and extravagant abbots .

After becoming a tropical storm on June 1 , Blanca rapidly intensified on June 2 \u2013 3 , becoming a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir \u2013 Simpson hurricane wind scale ; maximum sustained winds reached 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) at this time . The hurricane 's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water , resulting in a period of weakening . Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category 4 status on June 6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula . Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June 7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June 8 as a weak tropical storm .

The poem is the first of his 1819 odes , which include \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" and \" Ode to a Nightingale \" . \" Ode to Psyche \" is an experiment in the ode genre , and Keats 's attempt at an expanded version of the sonnet format that describes a dramatic scene . The poem serves as an important departure from Keats 's early poems , which frequently describe an escape into the pleasant realms of one 's imagination . Keats uses the imagination to show the narrator 's intent to resurrect Psyche and reincarnate himself into Eros ( love ) . Keats attempts this by dedicating an \" untrodden region \" of his mind to the worship of the neglected goddess .",

Due to the conditions in the Alps , and a series of accidents , extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s , and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease .

By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor , but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water . The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant , which had been occupied in 1940 ; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments , it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon . Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical , and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant , demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden .",

Shortly after the start of his reign , Wihtred issued a code of laws \u2014 the Law of Wihtred \u2014 that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the Textus Roffensis . The laws pay a great deal of attention to the rights of the Church , including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship . Wihtred 's long reign had few incidents recorded in the annals of the day . He was succeeded in 725 by his sons , \u00c6thelberht II , Eadberht I , and \u00c6lfric .",

Remaining nearly stationary for a day , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion . Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated , skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina . Early on August 10 , Belle made landfall on Long Island , New York , as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm . Thereafter , Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada . The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August 15 to the south of Iceland .",

The metric system was originally conceived as a system of measurement that was derivable from nature . When the metric system was first introduced in France in 1799 technical problems necessitated the use of artifacts such as the prototype metre and kilogram . In 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of light from a specified source , making it derivable from nature , leaving the kilogram as the only unit still defined by an artifact .
